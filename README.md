# Tetriling-Puzzle / Grid tiling problem

- conv_dataset_gen.py is used to generate dataset (Used dataset could not be uploaded as it is too large)

- conv_deep_learning.py is used to train model (trained_conv_net_3 is a pretrained model)

- main.py contains the main algorithm which takes in target and outputs solution

- performance_test_v2.py tests algorithm by importing  main.py and running solution with a generated target, visually displaying the results results and the runtime

- Tetriling Puzzl Report.odt is a report explaining how the algortihm works
